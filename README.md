References for Narcan toolkit

## How to View the References Page

The `docs/index.html` file is a webpage that must be viewed in a web browser, not directly in the GitHub repository browser.

### Option 1: View via GitHub Pages (Recommended)

If GitHub Pages is enabled for this repository, you can access the page at:
`https://bmn599.github.io/References/`

### Option 2: View Locally

To view the page on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bmn599/References.git
   cd References
   ```

2. Open the HTML file in your browser:
   - **On macOS**: `open docs/index.html`
   - **On Linux**: `xdg-open docs/index.html`
   - **On Windows**: `start docs/index.html`
   
   Or simply drag and drop the `docs/index.html` file into your web browser.

### Setting Up GitHub Pages

If GitHub Pages is not yet enabled, follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings**
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select the branch (usually `main` or `master`)
5. Select the `/docs` folder as the source directory
6. Click **Save**
7. GitHub will provide you with the URL where your page is published (usually `https://bmn599.github.io/References/`)

**Note:** Do not view `index.html` directly in the GitHub repository browser, as it will display the raw HTML code instead of rendering the webpage.
